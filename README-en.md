This is an ArkTS VSCode extension developed based on Volar. üåπ It appears that there has been no proper support for ArkTS in VSCode until now. Most of the existing ArkTS extensions in the VSCode marketplace are very basic, so I decided to write one myself.

## Features

- üåπ Starting from version 1.x, complete `ArkTS` language support is available, fully supporting all `ArkTS` syntax.
- üñäÔ∏è Comprehensive JSON Schema support. Supports the following JSON Schema files:
  - `build-profile.json5` Module-level/Project-level configuration
  - `oh-package.json5` Module-level/Project-level configuration
  - `module.json5` Module-level/Project-level configuration
  - `code-linter.json5` Module-level/Project-level configuration
  - All `color.json` files under `resources/element/` for kv value configuration
  - `main_pages.json5`
- üì¶ Starting from version 1.x, supports installation and management of `OpenHarmony SDK`, and automatically detects the `API version` of the currently opened project, showing popup prompts for `download` or `switch`
- üÜì `$r`, `$rawfile` completion, code formatting, `hilog` logging and other features are planned for future support. PRs are welcomed üëÄ

## Extension Installation üì¶

- Marketplace installation: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NailyZero.vscode-naily-ets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NailyZero.vscode-naily-ets)
- Open VSX installation: [https://open-vsx.org/extension/NailyZero/vscode-naily-ets](https://open-vsx.org/extension/NailyZero/vscode-naily-ets)

Or simply search for `ArkTS Support` in VSCode.

## Usage Guide üìñ

### When DevEco Studio is already installed

After installing this extension, configure the `OpenHarmony SDK` path and `HMS SDK` path (optional), then restart the IDE. These two `SDK paths` are usually found in a folder called `sdk` in the `DevEco Studio` installation directory.

On macOS, right-click on `DevEco Studio` itself, select `Show Package Contents`, and you'll see a `sdk` folder inside the package containing `OpenHarmony SDK` and `HMS SDK`.

Generally, `OpenHarmony SDK` has the following directory structure (referenced from version `DevEco Studio 6.0 Beta 2`):

```
ets/
js/
native/
previewer/
toolchains/
```

`HMS SDK` generally has the following directory structure (referenced from version `DevEco Studio 6.0 Beta 2`):

```
ets/
native/
previewer/
toolchains/
```

### When DevEco Studio is not installed

Currently, this extension still cannot completely replace HarmonyOS development. It's recommended that you install `DevEco Studio`. If you really don't want to install it, the extension also provides `download`, `extract and install`, and `seamless switching` features for `OpenHarmony SDK`. After installing this extension, you can search for `> ETS: Install OpenHarmony SDK` in the command palette and follow the prompts step by step.

Additionally, the extension currently doesn't support `download`, `extract and install`, and `seamless switching` features for `HMS SDK`. Please download `DevEco Studio` or download HarmonyOS's `Command Line Tool` for installation.

## About `ets.baseSdkPath` ‚ö†Ô∏è

This setting is used to configure the `base path` for `OpenHarmony SDK`. All versions of `OpenHarmony SDK` will be installed under this path.

If the path is configured as `${os.homedir}/OpenHarmony`, the extension will automatically install `OpenHarmony SDK` in the `~/OpenHarmony/[API version, number]` folder and automatically detect the `API version` used by the current project, automatically switching to the corresponding `OpenHarmony SDK`. For example, if you want to install `OpenHarmony SDK` for `API20`, the extension will automatically install it in the `~/OpenHarmony/20` folder:

```
~/OpenHarmony
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 18
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ets/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ native/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ previewer/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ toolchains/
```

This behavior is completely consistent with the `Settings -> OpenHarmony SDK` feature in `DevEco Studio`.

## VSCode File Icon Pack üñºÔ∏è

It's recommended to use [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme). I've submitted a PR to `Material Icon Theme`, and currently `.ets` and `.d.ets` files directly use the `TypeScript official file icon pack`. This is available in versions after upgrading to `v5.22.0`, making it look much better üëá
